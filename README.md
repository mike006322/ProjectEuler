About Project Euler:
>"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer
programming problems that will require more than just mathematical
insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant
and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills
will be required to solve most problems.
The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to
provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar
areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context."
